    "### Summary\n",
    "Slattbot was a somewhat successful attempt at exploring AI and human response to different positive, negative, and neutral sentiment at varying levels of intensity. \n",
    "\n",
    "My initial scope included these goals:\n",
    "* Train multiple AI models on tweets from musical artists with ‘cult-like’ followings\n",
    "* Build a responsive community of these AI on Twitter\n",
    "* See how positive/negative sentiment affect the sentiment and likelihood of reply\n",
    "     * Both AI and human responses\n",
    "* Predict reply count, sentiment based on tweet \n",
    "\n",
    "However, several challenges limited the progress and full completion of the goals. I will address these shortcomings as they appear in the write-up."

    "### Research Proposal\n",
    "Originally I wanted to use smash bros tournament data to predict seeding upsets. I wanted to build a webscraper and subsequently store my data in Google Cloud Platform. Thus, much of my research was dedicated to learning GCP, which I did eventually use for much of my data storage. I also wanted to use pytorch to make the model for the predictions, but I pivoted to tensorflow instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "I spent much of this time figuring out the tensorflow basics and decided I wanted to do text generation for my tutorial. I based much of my work off of the tensorflow [website](https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/text_generation)"

    "### Project Proposal\n",
    "Here is where I fully put down my goals and what I wanted to achieve in the project. I wanted to...\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create generative text bots that output tweets on a (daily?) schedule\n",
    "* Make them interact in a community-like setting\n",
    "* Reply based on probablity of interaction\n",
    "* Allow bots to like and rt \n",
    "* Visualize interaction over time\n",
    "\n",
    "I think one of my biggest challenges was defining the overall scope of the project at this point. There is a lot of ideas here, but it is less-so data focused and doesn't really have any measurable goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tech stack\n",
    "I decided to use\n",
    "* SNScrape - get historical data\n",
    "* GCP (cloud scheduler - publishing tweets, big query - storing new data)\n",
    "* tweepy - get new data, manipulate bots\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided that I wanted to retrain the model offline with the new data on certain intervals and push it to the cloud to save on costs."
