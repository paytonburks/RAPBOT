# SlattBot

A project that trains a model based on @youngthug tweets on twitter. Aims to explore the relationship between AI and human sentiment response and intensity of replies.

Workflow runs to fetch new data every 24h from twitter. If new data, models & EDA will retrain and update as data is added to the csv file.
